# Welcome!

My name is Lily Gruman. I am a [cellist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello) and engineer based in the US.

# Background

I earned undergraduate degrees in music and electrical engineering at [Iowa State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University), 
worked for three years as a software engineer, and then uprooted myself to pursue graduate study in music.

## Undergrad (2015-2019)

At ISU, I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, with Honors and a minor in Music Technology, as well as a B.A. in Music.

<summary>ECpE</summary>

While studying electrical engineerinng, I became familiar with topics such as
* [circuit theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network)
* [digital logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)
* [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation)
* [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)
* [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator)
  [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission)
  and [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor)
* [alternative energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* [fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis) and synthesis
* [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism)
* [automatic control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_control)
* [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system)
* [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit)

I focused particularly on control systems, with additional focuses in electromagnetism and embedded systems.

I was also introduced to several programming languages and software tools, including
* [Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB)/[Simulink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulink)
* [PSpice](https://www.pspice.com/)
* [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)
* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
* [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)
* [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
* [Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software))
* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
* [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
* [ARM Cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family)
* [Cadence Virtuoso](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/virtuoso-studio.html)
* [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)

My senior design project consisted of a proof-of-concept design for a food vending system that would automatically reorder new merchandise when supply ran low, making an attempt to optimize the bundling of restock deliveries. While I worked primarily on the sensor prototype, others on our team developed a networking model, a frontend portal, and a routing algorithm.

<summary>Music Technology</summary>
  
The Minor in Music Technology focused on three areas of computer-based tools for music composition, performance, and production:
1. Digital Audio Workstations ([Pro Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Tools))
2. Programming ([Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)))
3. Sampling and Synthesis ([Kontakt, Reaktor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Instruments))

<summary>Honors</summary>

In addition to a breadth of seminars, the honors component of my degree required an additional capstone project, which I derived from the music technology portion of my studies. Specifically, I created a Max patch that would attempt to generate well-formed counterpoint for a given cantus firmus, using the first-species guidelines outlined in Johann Fux's [*Gradus ad Parnassum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradus_ad_Parnassum). It is implemented using an application of [Dijkstra's Shortest-Path-First algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) in a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) representation of the allowed possible notes. In the submitted version, the edges are naively set to the sizes of the melodic intervals, but a smarter version could adjust those weights based on other factors.

<summary>Music</summary>

Thanks to AP credit from high school, mostly in calculus and physics, I had just enough room in my schedule to squeeze in a music degree in addition to engineering. Throughout this course of study, I performed several solo and chamber pieces.

#### Concertos
* [Dvo≈ô√°k's Cello Concerto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Concerto_(Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k))
* [Schumann's Cello Concerto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Concerto_(Schumann))
* [Shostakovich's Cello Concerto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Concerto_No._1_(Shostakovich))
* [Saint-Saens' Cello Concerto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Concerto_No._1_(Saint-Sa%C3%ABns))

#### Sonatas
* [Brahms' Cello Sonata No. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Sonata_No._2_(Brahms))
* [Beethoven's Cello Sonata No. 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Sonatas_Nos._4_and_5_(Beethoven))

#### Chamber Music
* TODO

## Grad School (2022-2024)

After a pandemic of personal reflection, I decided to make a few major changes to my path in life, one of which was to pursue a Master's degree in cello performance at the [University of Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas).
